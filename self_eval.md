# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? Setting up the if statement in my hash at the end. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? I like to take notes during class and then underline the notes I think are most important. 
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? Trying to solve on my own, but I also tap into google sometimes.
